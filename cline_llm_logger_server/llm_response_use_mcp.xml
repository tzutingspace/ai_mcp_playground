The user is asking about the weather in New York tomorrow. I can see from the environment details that there's a weather MCP server available (`weather_`). This server has tools for getting weather forecasts and alerts.

I should use the `get_forecast` tool from the weather MCP server to get the weather forecast for New York. However, I need the latitude and longitude coordinates for New York City.

Let me first check what tools are available in the weather MCP server and then use the fetch tool to get the coordinates for New York City if needed.
